Survival and Censoring times: There is a true survival time, T, as well as a true censoring time, C. (The survival time is also known as the failure time or the event time) 
The survival time represents the time at which the event of interest occurs. 
The censoring time is the time at which censoring occurs. 
The random variable is represented by Y = min(T,C) indicator function 
We need to assume that the censoring mechanism is independent: conditional on the features, the event time T is independent of the censoring time C. 
Interval censoring refers to the setting in which we do not know the exact event time, but we know that it falls in some interval.
