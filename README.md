### STA496

This is the place where I would share my STA496 Learning notes and make a diary of my learning processes. In this research project, I would focus on replication study and exploring public health with statistical learning.  From week1 to week5, I would read several chapters (approximately right chapters) on ISLRv2, and the plan is chapter11 for week1&2, chapter5 and chapter6 for week3, chapter7 and chapter8 for week4, chapter9, chapter10 and chapter12 for week5. Starting from week6, I would start to replicate one paper.
