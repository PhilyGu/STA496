From week1 to week5, I would read some chapters on ISLRv2, and the plan is chapter11 for week1&2, chapter5 and chapter6 for week3, chapter7 and chapter8 for week4, chapter9, chapter10 and chapter12 for week5.

Start from week6, I would replicate the paper, which is available at https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-019-0796-7
