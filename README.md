### STA496

This is the place where I would share my STA496 Learning notes and make a diary of my learning processes. In this research project, I would focus on replication study and exploring public health with statistical learning Methods. From week1 to week5, I would read several chapters (approximately right chapters) on ISLRv2, and the plan is 
+ Week1&2: Chapter11 (Survival Analysis and Censored Data)
+ Week3: Chapter5 and Chapter6 (Resampling Methods, and Linear Model selection and Regularization)
+ Week4: Chapter7 and Chapter8 (Moving Beyong Linearity and Tree-Based Methods)  
+ Week5: chapter9, chapter10 and chapter12 (Support Vector Machines, Deep Learning and Unsupervised Learning)
+ Starting from week6, I would start to replicate one paper.
