### STA496

This is the place where I would share my STA496 Learning notes and make a diary of my learning process.

Reading ISLRv2 plan: chapter5 and chapter6 for week3, chapter7 and chapter8 for week4, chapter9 and chapter10 for week5.

In the following month, I would replicate the paper, which is available at https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-019-0796-7
