### STA496 (Readings in Statistics)

This is the place where I share my STA496 Learning notes and make a diary of my learning processes. In this research project, I focus on Replication Study and Exploring Public Health with Statistical Learning Methods. From week1 to week5, I read several chapters (approximately eight chapters) on ISLRv2, and the plan is 
+ Week1: ISLR 5,6,7 (Resampling Methods, Linear Model selection and Regularization, Moving Beyong Linearity)
+ Week2: ISLR 8,9,10 (Tree-Based Methods, Support Vector Machines, Deep Learning)
+ Week3: ISLR 11,12,13 (Survival Analysis and Censored Data, Unsupervised Learning, Multiple Testing)
+ Week4: ESL 13,14,15 (Prototype Methods and Nearest-Neighbors, Unsupervised Learning, Random Forests)
+ Week5: ESL 16,17,18 (Ensemble Learning, Undirected Graphical Models, High-Dimensional Problems)  
+ Week6~12: work on replications

#### Replications
I choose the paper "Explainable statistical learning in public health for policy development: the case of real-world suicide data" to replicate. And weekly progress and results of my replication are in the folder Replication.
