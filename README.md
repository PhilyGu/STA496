### STA496

This is the place where I would share my STA496 Learning notes and make a diary of my learning processes. In this research project, I would focus on replication study and exploring public health with statistical learning. (Textbook:Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R, second version)

From week1 to week5, I would read several chapters (approximately right chapters) on ISLRv2, and the plan is chapter11 for week1&2, chapter5 and chapter6 for week3, chapter7 and chapter8 for week4, chapter9, chapter10 and chapter12 for week5. 

Starting from week6, I would replicate the paper, which is available at https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-019-0796-7 (key words: public health, statistical learning)
